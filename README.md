# QXT JS8Call
QXT JS8Call Tools is a collection of small, service-friendly Python scripts that talk to JS8Callâ€™s JSON API to streamline common tasks and add operator conveniences to run on Linux, Windows and MacOS. 

Scripts:
- SNR-Beacon: sending periodic SNR? to a group (with an immediate first TX), simple relays, and lightweight logging of activity. All tools are cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS), use only the Python standard library, and are easy to run under systemd or Windows Task Scheduler.

Features: scheduled beacons, group messaging helpers, retry/timeout handling, clean logging.

Requirements: Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies).
