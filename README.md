QXT JS8Call Tools is a collection of small, service-friendly Python scripts that talk to JS8Callâ€™s JSON API to streamline common tasks and add operator conveniences. All tools are cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS), use only the Python libraries, and are easy to run under systemd or Windows Task Scheduler.

Requirements: Python 3.8+.

Scripts:
- [SNR-Beacon](https://github.com/QuixoteSystems/QXT-JS8Call-Tools/tree/main/SNR-Beacon): sending periodic SNR? to a group (with an immediate first TX), simple relays, and lightweight logging of activity.
